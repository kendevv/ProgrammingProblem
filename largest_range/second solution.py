#Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of length 2 representing the largest range of numbers contained in that array. 
#The first number in the output array should be the first number in the range while the second number should be the last number in the range.
#Arange of numbers is defined as a set of numbers that come right after each other in the set of real integers. 
#For instance, the output array (2,6]represents the range (2,3,4,5,6), which isarange of length 5.
#Note that numbers do not need to be ordered or adjacent in the array in order to form a range. Assume that there will only be one largest range.
#Sample input: [1, 11,3,0,15,5,2,4,10,7,12,6] 
#Sample output: (0,7)
